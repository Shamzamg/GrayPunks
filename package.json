  "description": "There are 9,999 GrayPunks. All of them are unique and live in a lost grayscale world. They are damned from coloured life and wander in a parallel dimension as CryptoPunks cousins. In this realm, fees are low and the kingdom is called Polygon. The ownership of a GrayPunk will grant you access to exclusive drops and surprising content.",
